## üê≥ Docker Usage

### 1. Clone This Repository

First, clone the repository and navigate to the folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deekshith0509/docker-kivy-apk-builder.git
cd docker-kivy-apk-builder
```

### 2. Build the Docker Image

Build the Docker image using the provided `Dockerfile`:

```bash
docker build -t kivy-apk .
```

This command will build the Docker image with all the necessary dependencies, such as Buildozer, OpenJDK 17, Android SDK/NDK, Python 3, and related build tools.

### 3. Prepare Your Kivy Project

Make sure your Kivy project directory contains the necessary files for Buildozer:

```
my-kivy-app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ buildozer.spec
```

### 4. Run APK Build

To build your APK, run the following command inside your project directory:

```bash
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app kivy-apk
```

This command mounts your project folder into the Docker container, runs the Buildozer process, and places the APK file in your host machine's `./bin` directory.

### 5. Retrieve the APK

Once the build completes, the resulting APK file will be available in your project directory, under:

```
./bin/yourapp-debug.apk
```

### 6. Clean Up

After building the APK, it's recommended to clean up the temporary Buildozer directory to keep your project clean:

```bash
rm -rf .buildozer/
```

## üí° Environment Variables

- **JAVA_HOME**: `/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64` (points to the installed JDK).
- **ANDROID_SDK_ROOT**: `/root/.buildozer/android/platform/android-sdk` (the path to the Android SDK inside the container).
- **PATH**: Includes the Android SDK‚Äôs `cmdline-tools` and `platform-tools` for easy access to Android tools like `sdkmanager` and `adb`.
- **DEBIAN_FRONTEND**: Set to `noninteractive` to avoid interactive prompts during package installations.
- **PYTHONUNBUFFERED**: Ensures Python output is not buffered, useful for logs.
- **LANG/LC_ALL**: Set to `C.UTF-8` for consistent UTF-8 handling.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Buildozer Configuration

The image is preconfigured to use **Buildozer** for building the APKs. Buildozer relies on the `buildozer.spec` file to configure the build process.

Ensure your `buildozer.spec` file is properly configured for your Kivy project. Common configuration options include:

- **Package Name**: Set the package name of your app (`package.name`).
- **Version**: Set the version of your app (`version`).
- **Requirements**: Specify Python dependencies for the project (`requirements`).
- **Android Permissions**: Set the necessary permissions required for your app (`android.permissions`).
  
## üìù Notes on Android SDK Setup

The Android SDK and NDK are preinstalled and configured in the Docker image. The `sdkmanager` is used to install necessary SDK packages. All licenses are auto-accepted during the build process.

If you need to install additional SDK or NDK components, you can use the following command within the container (the image includes the `sdkmanager` tool):

```bash
sdkmanager --sdk_root=$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT "platform-tools" "platforms;android-33" "build-tools;33.0.2" "ndk;25.2.9519653"
```

This command installs or updates specific SDK components.

## üìÇ Dockerfile Details

The provided `Dockerfile` creates a Docker image with the following steps:

1. **Base Image**: Starts from the `ubuntu:20.04` image.
2. **Environment Variables**: Configures necessary environment variables such as `JAVA_HOME`, `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`, and `PATH` for Android tools.
3. **Installing Dependencies**: Installs Python 3, Android SDK, NDK, build tools, and other required libraries using `apt-get` and `pip`.
4. **Android SDK Setup**: Downloads and unzips the Android command line tools and sets them up in the correct directory.
5. **Buildozer Installation**: Installs Buildozer for automatic APK building.
6. **SDK Configuration**: Sets up the SDK, installs necessary packages, and accepts SDK licenses automatically.
7. **SDK Tool Fix**: Fixes Buildozer's expected SDK path for compatibility with `sdkmanager` and `avdmanager`.
8. **Working Directory**: Sets the working directory to `/app`, where your Kivy project will be mounted.

## üßπ Clean-Up Recommendations

It's recommended to clean up your Docker container and project folder regularly to keep the system tidy and reduce unnecessary space usage. Delete the `.buildozer/` folder after a build to remove temporary files.

```bash
rm -rf .buildozer/
```

## üí° Troubleshooting

- **SDK Installation Errors**: If you encounter issues with the Android SDK installation, verify that your internet connection is stable and that the `sdkmanager` commands are working correctly.
- **Build Failures**: Check your `buildozer.spec` file for any misconfigurations, especially regarding package dependencies, permissions, and versions.
